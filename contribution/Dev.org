* Working Log
** Draft / Rough Idea
*** Project Management
    Two ways of manage project
    - Central - workspace: All projects hard/soft stored/connected with workspace
      * Project <> Server!
      * Customizing Variable
      * Default directory while setup project
      * A project directory (projects.xml)!
    - Distributed: projects directoy can be put anywhere.
    *Update*: put into a project.json which outside of current project to avoid
    expose project directory information into source code repository.
*** Version management
    Involve git.
    Introduce action like in below:
    - abapgit pull 
      1. *retrieve* source from server into local branch ~server~
      2. merge back to local ~master~ branch.
    - abapgit push 
      1. *retrieve* source from server into local branch ~server~
      2. merge local ~master~ branch to ~server~ and do *submit*
      3. optionally with *Activate* action
    - abapgit check
      1. call *check* action

    With ~buffer-string~ somehow, it didn't work!
    Nothing related with ~buffer-string~, but the content size.
    How to solve => Change to https!
